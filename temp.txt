The past decade has been marked by a significant increase in internet access media
and an abundance of cloud-based storage, high-definition multimedia streaming, and
services providing software, platforms, and infrastructures (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). This
has resulted in an unprecedented demand in the speed and volume of data transfers. As
forecasted by Cisco (Fig. 1.1), this demand will definitely continue to grow. By the year
2018, 8.6 zettabytes of data will be transferred per year [1]. What is astounding is that
75% of this network traffic is within the datacenter itself (east-west traffic pattern). On top
of that, the internet of things or everything (IoT/IoE) is still nascent. It can be speculated
that as IoT develops, it will further exacerbate network congestion within datacenters.
Moreover, the massive volume of data has resulted in the creation of large ware-house scale
datacenters. For such long and fast links, optical interconnects are believed to be superior
to other forms of interconnects and are now becoming inevitable.
